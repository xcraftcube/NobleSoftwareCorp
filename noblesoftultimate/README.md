# Noble Software Ultimate

## About Noble Software Ultimate:

This is my first OS project I've created in Scratch.

For the name Noble Soft I was inspired by the game Thief Simulator, where OS boxes just appeared, mainly Noble Soft, but also SoftBox and PC Master Soft.

I created the first version for Noble Soft Ultimate on April 28, 2021, and in my opinion it was a breakthrough in my interest in programming.

As this was my first OS project in Scratch I didn't create the image files myself, I mostly downloaded them from the internet, so they mostly don't match, which I changed in my other projects.
